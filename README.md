# Portfolio-Template

Portfolio Template is a template website that allows users to fill in their information and use it as a portfolio/online resume. It also includes a “contact via e-mail” option that allows users to contact the owner of the website by submitting a message and leaving their e-mail as a contact option.

Steps:

1- Download the project as a zip file
2- Extract the folder
3- Choose the page you want to customize and open it with Visual Studio Code
4- Fill in your information
5- Host your website and a domain name

Feel free to design it as you wish: The website provided is simple, leaving the option of designing the frontend to the user. (Add more tabs to the navigation bar, change colors…)

**Disclaimer: This template was a simple university project, it’s free to use and I don’t claim any responsibility for any errors or malfunctions on your end!**
